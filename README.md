# GM4 Resources 32x32
Welcome to the repository for the Gamemode 4 resource pack with Faithful. This pack is made to be completely optional, utilising the `CustomModelData` functionality. As a result, this resource pack is for Minecraft 1.14+.

Note: this was made for putting over the standard GM4 Resources and should not be used without.
Also this was made with a pre-jappa version of faithful.

This was first made in https://github.com/Adriaan1313/GM4_Datapacks, but now has been moved to its own repo
